I) QA Bot Interaction:

  1)Upload Multiple PDFs: Users can easily upload one or more PDF documents to the application.
  2)Question-Answer (QA) Bot: The heart of the application is a Question-Answer (QA) bot, which leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries.
  3)Interact with PDFs: Users can engage in interactive conversations with the QA bot, asking questions about the content of the uploaded PDFs.
  4)Quick Information Retrieval: This feature is particularly useful for quickly extracting specific information or insights from extensive PDF documents without the need to manually skim through them.

II) News Query via SERPAPI:

  1)Current Events and News: In addition to PDF interaction, the application offers a news query feature.
  2)SERPAPI Integration: The bot integrates with SERPAPI (Search Engine Results Page API) to provide real-time and up-to-date information on current events and news.
  3)Ask About Current Events: Users can ask the bot questions related to current events, news topics, or any queries they have about the latest happenings.
  4)Instant Responses: The bot retrieves and presents relevant information from the web, ensuring users stay informed about the latest developments in various fields.
